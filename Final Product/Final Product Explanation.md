**Final Product Explanation**
==========

The final product was built using a regular JS framework. JQuery and React had their various drawbacks and advantages, but in the end, I chose to settle for using regular JavaScript. 

The website consisted of 5 separate pages, each utilising unique elements studied over the course of this project, such as UI elements like charts and maps or HTTP requests to APIs.

The 'global' page displays statistics for COVID-19 across the world, like Total cases, Deaths and Recoveries. This data was fetched from the API and simply displayed on the page using an ID. The other statistics, like active cases and mortality rate, were calculated using numerical operators. Chart.js was also used on this page to create a pie chart that was divided into three sections, active cases, deaths and recoveries. 

The 'countries' page displays stats for individual countries. Like global, similar stats are displayed, in addition to other comprehensive stats like population density, diabetes prevalence and average age. The stats will be selected through a drop down list that is filled using an array of country names.

The 'maps' page displays a full map of the world, with hotspots of differing size based on the impact of the virus on that country. Clicking on one of the hotspots will display numbers like confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries. 

The 'SIR' page displays information about how the model works, and the algorithms behind the modelling program.

The 'resources' page displays info about the APIs, libraries and other resources used over the project's development, with links to relevant documentation for each resource.

The website is now live. Check it out here:
