**React Explanation**
=========

This folder contains all files pertaining to the react application developed. React pre-provisions materials when creating a new project, which can be seen as a disadvantage to some, and complicates sharing of the source code. 

In order to create a react app, a terminal command like _npx create react app_ so that these materials can be provisioned. The app also runs on a local host port, so auto-reloading is enabled, and a terminal command like _npm start_ need to be run in order to launch the app. Running the app again while it's currently being hosted on the port means it will open again on a separate port. 

React is really good for simplifying the syntax for a lot of UI elements, just like JQuery is with HTTP requests, so the developer has more freedom to create cards or graphs etc.

Overall, React is a really powerful framework, but there's a really big learning curve, and it can sometimes be overwhelming to have a bunch of materials dumped on you, and to learn the syntax of modular css, or jsx.
