**JQuery Explanation**
======

In this folder, there's a script for the prototype developed using the JQuery library.

A common theme you'll notice among the 3 prototypes was that there wasn't much focus on CSS for me, as it would've taken an unnecessary amount of time creating my own stylesheet with style rules that I would've needed to put a lot of thought into in order to make sure colour and format blended together perfectly with my elements.

In order to alleviate that, I decided to download a pre-made stylesheet from the website Bootstrap. They, alongisde other similar services, offer users with stylesheets that they can either link to in the HTML using URLs, or download and then link to them. For the purposes of ensuring these prototypes are maintainable, I chose the download option, as it means that my program is kept in maintainable condition, as I don't need to hope that Bootstrap's website stays on the web if I were to link to it. This way, all the style rules I need are already written inside of the file that I have downloaded on my drive, and there's no risk of them being changed ever. A small thing to consider is the font, which is linked to inside of the file using the Google Fonts API, so these prototypes will only lose some style applications assuming that the Google Fonts API stops running. 

Now, with that out of the way, I'll move onto the HTML and JS code.
