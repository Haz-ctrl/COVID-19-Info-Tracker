# COVID-19-Info-Tracker

This is the repository for all the files pertaining to the COVID-19 Info Tracker, as part of my CREST Gold Award Project. The repo will contain all the scripts I've created over the course of my project time.

The project's aim is to create a solution which will display relevant COVID-19 statistical information (cases, recoveries, deaths) for the whole world as well as by each individual country. A main problem I identified with other similar applications like this was the lack of inclusion of other data points that are still useful to consider, like the average age or abundance of diabetes in each country. 

While there is no quantitive correlation or coefficient that can draw a parallel between the abundance of Diabetes and the number of cases in a country, I still thought this information was important to include, as there's a difference between creating an application which just displays data, versus creating an application that tries to do something meaningful with it, like trying to explain why it is the way it is, or performing a calculation on it.

That was the main focus of the project. What was going to set this tracker apart from others just like it? Creating a more comprehensive commentary on statistical info relating to the virus was really important.

There were also a number of development changes that occured during the course of project, like experimenting with different frameworks for back-end development, like trying out libraries such as React, JQuery and Vue, comparing how they handled GET requests to the API, and deciding on what framework I wanted to settle on for the final product. 

Ultimately, I decided to settle for regular JS, as it was the most familiar to me, and the code was easier to digest and understand. I covered the various drawbacks and advantages of the different frameworks in my final paper, but it should be noted that I will also upload the 'prototypes' developed using React, JQuery and Vue to this repo, alongside the final product written in plain JavaScript. 

That's the gist of the project, and the information of everything you can find in this repo. This project has been a really valuable and fun experience to venture outside of my safe zone and try out different frameworks in back-end development that, up until now, I had no prior experience with. I hope you enjoy it! Thanks :)
